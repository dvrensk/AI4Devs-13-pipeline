# David's prompts

## Prompt 1

I want to perform a scan of all files and technologies used in @backend  , as well as a list of dependencies and/or libraries, and finally business model concepts.

## Prompt 2

Document the project in /backend/docs

## Prompt 3

I want to serve the @backend  project from an AWS server running ubuntu. I've heard good things about PM2 but I'm equally interested in running docker. I'm familiar with nginx but not with acme. For the moment, I would be happy to run the DB server on the same host, either natively or with docker. I want to deploy with CI/CD on github, iff the tests pass. I want to use TLS and I have a domain name that I can point where I want, but I also want to be able to shut down the server when I don't use it, and I assume that I will lose the IP number then.
Please outline 4 or 5 options.

## Prompt 4

Option 2 sounds fine. Please create a file `/backend/deploy-todo.md` and create a list of things that we need to do according to this plan. Assume that I have and AWS account but no server.
